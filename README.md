# Ice Cream Clouds
## In celebration of Earth Day, a modest proposal for solving global climate change

Global climate change and rainbow sprinkles are real.  Sadly, ice cream clouds are not.  If you love this planet and the people on it, do what you can to save the Earth: drive less, eat less meat, switch to renewable energy sources, live in cities, and most importantly vote for leaders who take this issue seriously.
