# Ice Cream Clouds
## In celebration of Earth Day, a modest proposal for solving global climate change
Dateline: the future...

We only had one planet and things were getting worse.  It was time for drastic action. The scientists and engineers brainstormed. The first idea was to harness volcanoes to pump sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere, but no one wanted acid rain-- too sour.

The next idea was extra reflective clouds spun from sugar and soy.  It could certainly work if the math was right. The only drawback was baseball sized hail that would bonk people on the head. What a headache! Everyone was downhearted, but then Professor van Stroopwafel thought of a way to make the hail softer, sweeter, and overall ice creamier.

It worked! In year three, they even figured out how to add toppings.  Now every summer folks gather in parks and on lawns to catch ice cream from the skies.

Catch falling scoops of ice cream and toppings to complete each order.

Global climate change and rainbow sprinkles are real.  Sadly, ice cream clouds are not.  If you love this planet and the people on it, do what you can to save the Earth: drive less, eat less meat, switch to renewable energy sources, live in cities, and most importantly vote for leaders who take this issue seriously.
